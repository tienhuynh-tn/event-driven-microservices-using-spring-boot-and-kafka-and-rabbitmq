# Event-driven Microservices using Spring Boot and RabbitMQ

## What is event-drive architecture?
Event-driven architecture is a software design pattern in which decoupled applications can asynchronously publish and 
subscribe to events via an event broker/message broker.

In an event-driven architecture, applications communicate with each other by sending and/or receiving events or messages.

Event-driven architecture is often referred to as "asynchronous" communication.

Event-driven apps can be created in any programming language because event-driven is a programming approach, not a language.

An event-driven architecture is loosely coupled.
